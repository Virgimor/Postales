            <h1>SANCTUARY OF ANDUJAR</h1>
            <p class="contenido-carta">The Sanctuary was finally built between 1287 and 1304 on the La Cabeza hill, and was renovated at the end of the 16th century. Since 1930, the Trinitarians have been attending worship in the Sanctuary and maintaining devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary throughout the year, who also accompany the image of the Virgin during the procession along the roads in the pilgrimage in the month of April. It is tradition that two religious of this order, standing on the litter, next to the venerated image of the Virgin of the Head, bring objects and children closer to it so that they receive their blessing and protection.

                The name of the Virgin “De la Cabeza” has its origin in the place name of the Hill where the statuette of the Virgin was found, known in Andújar as de la Cabeza, as this is the highest hill in Sierra Morena. Furthermore, at the top there was a large rock that was shaped like a head.

                <br><br>Hello Jules Mark A. We would like you to visit our wonderful sanctuary since it is a perfect place to go in April when the Andujar pilgrimage is celebrated. I look forward to your visit!</p>
